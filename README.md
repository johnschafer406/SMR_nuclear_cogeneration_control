# SMR_nuclear_cogeneration_control
This study explores cogeneration control in Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) to enable load following within microgrids. 
This project investigates whether SMRs, traditionally used as baseload generators, can adapt to fluctuating demands using steam extraction and bypass valves. 
A dynamic model simulates a 50 MWe NuScale SMR, evaluating Proportional- Integral (PI) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) methods. 
Results suggest that MPC significantly outperforms PI control, adeptly balancing load demands while minimizing steam waste. 
This offers a promising avenue for integrating SMRs into renewable-heavy mi- crogrids, potentially reducing reliance on auxiliary Distributed Energy Resources (DERs).
